# Predict author based on his text

This program takes a `csv` file as an input training data containing the texts of the writer and his name. It then cleans and normalizes them and uses the `Bag-og-words` technique to train a `Linear Regression` model. Test data are stored in a separate dataset. The results would be saved into `out.csv` file
